**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.


I have not worked since 2016. In the 8 years since, work culture and society in general has greatly changed. I have changed. The idea of ethics and inequity was not something I thought much about when I did work. As technology evolves and becomes an integral part of our lives, I will definitely keep these concepts in mind as I navigate through my career.

In my years as a laboratory technician, I never held any management roles. Despite that, I always tried to treat everyone with respect regardless of who they were and what position they held. We have all been that junior employee at one point and I really believe in paying it forward and passing on my knowledge and experiences. I am not without my blind spots though. As I worked from entry to senior level, my relatively low positions afforded me the privilege to be mostly unaware of systemic inequalities. There were instances of inequality that directly effected me and for those, I spoke up for myself. I wish I had shared my views when the issues were more systemic in nature. It's a delicate balance to voice your opinions at work in a constructive, critical way. I hope I will continue to stand by my ideals and be brave enough to advocate for the benefit of everyone.

The best way we can combat the issue of ethics and inequity is to educate ourselves. We can not begin to implement these things in our work if we don't know how to define these concepts. If I had known back in my working days all of what I've learned since then, I probably would have had the confidence to speak out more. The tech industry has shown us the importance of information and data. We should harness this power to learn as much as we can. The Wired article we read in class about Pakistan was eye opening! I never knew there were countries that used familial connections to validate identity. It's a very interesting case study of how information and technology can affect society and everyday life. The more we learn and develop our critical and analytical thinking skills, the better we can implement ethics and inequity in technology, our work, and our lives.
